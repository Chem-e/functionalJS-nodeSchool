Object Oriented Programing - Summary:
* abstraction — creating a simple model of a more complex thing, which represents its most important aspects in a way       that is easy to work with for our program's purposes.
* object instances — objects that contain the data and functionality defined in the class.  
* When an object instance is created from a class, the class's constructor function is run to create it. This process of    creating an object instance from a class is called instantiation — the object instance is instantiated from the class.
* In OOP, we can create new classes based on other classes — these new child classes can be made to inherit the data and     code features of their parent class, so you can reuse functionality common to all the object types rather than having     to duplicate it.  
* Where functionality differs between classes, you can define specialized features directly on them as needed.
* new keyword is used to tell the browser we want to create a new object instance followed by the function name with its    required parameters contained in parentheses.
* this  keyworrd is used to refer the function.
* Pascal case is used for class/constructer name.
